Forecasting at scale

Tasks: forecasting

Why: capacity planning, goal setting, anomaly detection.


This paper is about fbprophet project.

combines configurable models with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis.

regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain komwledge about the time series.


Completely automatic forecasting: inflexible to incorporate useful assumptions or heuristics.

Data scientist, have domain expertise, do not have training in time series forecasting.

as a result, produce high quality forecasts are quite rare.

it becomes important to let machines do the hard work of model evaluation and comparison while efficiently using human feedback to fix performance problems.
